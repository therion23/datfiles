* "JARchive V8" - 594'840 titles. The full JARchive V8 (surprise!), however, split in four, due to Github's 100MB file limit (coming soon!). The .7z file contains the single dat.
* "JARchive V1 Lite" - 214'056 titles. Should be noted that this is the exact same contents as libretro's "Mobile - J2ME" database.
* "JARchive Lite V1 - V8DIFF" - 2'697 titles. The files in V1 Lite not found in V8, so if you want to save disk space, use V8 and this, and skip V1 Lite.
