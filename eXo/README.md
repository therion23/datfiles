Yes, there are zips within the Content collections. Should not hinder you from running the games on your own, though.

Also, these dats lack the "util" parts of the collections. They will require a bit of handwork though, but for starters, to get the install scripts working, you should remember to replace "unzip.exe" with a ZSTD capable one, in case you want to take advantage of RomVault's ZSTD capabilities (or modify the script entirely if you prefer 7-Zip).

Anyway, these are mostly for deduplication, and for those who want those collections inside their ROM manager "ecosystem".
