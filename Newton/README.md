## Newton
Origins: archive.org, 40hz.org and unna.org

Two quick and dirty DATs, one for firmware and one for updates. I strongly advise you to read https://newtonfaq.com/archives/20031101/newton-faq-nos.html in case you want to use them on real hardware, since it has crucial information about matching language versions and so on.

All files should run fine under either Einstein or Leibniz. Links can be found inside the DATs.
