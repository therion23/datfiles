## Neo Kobe
Origin: archive.org

[dsync89](https://github.com/dsync89/) did a fine job at DAT'ing the Neo Kobe sets. Or, rather, half of them. These are the remaining ones, plus a cleaner version of the Sharp X1, since theirs was a bit of a mess.

The FM Towns sets exclude the game ISOs on purpose. Redump maintain a DAT for those, so it seems rather irrelevant to make one based on old dumps. The "FD and HD" set also includes any CMOS dumps and whatever else would be necessary to run a given title.

The sets used were all uploaded to archive.org by someone who later deleted their account. Links can be found inside the DATs.
