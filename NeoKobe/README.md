[dsync89](https://github.com/dsync89/) did a fine job at DAT'ing the Neo Kobe sets. Or, rather, half of them. These are the remaining ones, plus a cleaner version of the Sharp X1, since theirs was a bit of a mess.

The sets used were all uploaded to archive.org by someone who later deleted their account. The link above will give you the most relevant search.
