## Neo Kobe

[dsync89](https://github.com/dsync89/) did a fine job at DAT'ing the Neo Kobe sets. Or, rather, half of them. These are the remaining ones, plus a cleaner version of the Sharp X1, since theirs was a bit of a mess.

The FM Towns sets only include what is relevant for emulation, not gaming. Since Redump maintain a DAT for the latter, it seems rather irrelevant to make one based on old dumps.

The sets used were all uploaded to archive.org by someone who later deleted their account. The link above will give you the most relevant search (look for the date 2016-02-25).
