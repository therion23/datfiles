## Palm OS
Origin: Everywhere

# tl;dr
The first DAT has been published and submitted to TOSEC. The rest will be pushed as they reach collection grade.

# First things first
A big thank you to the following:
- John Doe (T-En maintainer)
- rygar997
- Newpain

And of course
- The PalmDB community, especially scienceapps and musashi for supplying fodder for these DATs
- Them mighty fine folks at TOSEC

# Preface
I got my first Palm in 1998, and have been collecting software for the platform ever since. As it is right now, i have this "unsorted" folder amounting to around 900'000 files, and it is about time that gets properly catalogue'd.

Two or three years ago i thought there was hope for that folder, when no-intro started DAT'ing some Palm stuff. But alas, that was a short lived hope, since their collection is rather minimal and hardly ever updated.

So i started brainstorming and writing tools that could give me some sort of overview about the task ahead. So far, that has taken a bit more than four years (on and off, though). Meanwhile, "that" folder kept growing.

Now, the Rubicon has been crossed. No way out but forward go.

# Inclusions and exclusions
Whatever is in the Redump collection will not be included here, except for device software. First of all they do a mighty fine job, second, it is easily available, and most of all, i am not interested in disc images - their contents, however ..

Whatever is in the no-intro collection might or might not be included here. For now, not. First two reasons above also apply here.

Things like extracted firmware files will also be scrapped. If you really need those, rest assured, i will include everything you need.

Executable installers will be kept. I have to test them all out to check if they really contain Palm related stuff anyway, find version numbers and so forth (the 8.3 days were really not kind for this task). Any AV positives, true or false, will be placed in a seperate DAT for record keeping.

# Status:
So far, i am trying to collect and group everything that is not apps and games, and get that out of the way and inside the RomVault ecosystem. This means the primary focus is desktop software (including SDKs and suchlike), emu/simulators and firmware files, and all sorts of documentation - magazines included.

That bit is pretty much sorted out, at least when it comes to the sorting phase.

The next major category will be sorting out all the executable installers, which will be pure hell - that "unsorted" folder contains a lot of stuff for other platforms as well, so there is a lot of weeding out to be done there.

When THAT is done with, i will clean up what i have made so far, and push those DATs here as being collection grade.

# Grading
| Tag | Meaning |
| --- | ------- |
| Sorting | A folder is in the process of being filled up |
| Testing | Files are (as far as possible) being integrity checked |
| Cleaning | A preliminary DAT has been created, naming needs a major overhaul |
| Collecting | The DAT is good enough for me, TNC naming is needed, but contents will only be added to or moved, not removed |
| TOSEC | The DAT has been submitted to them fine folks over at TOSEC, i.e. the end of that road |
